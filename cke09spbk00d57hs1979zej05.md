## Submitting Forms in Netlify

On Netlify, any HTML form can instantly accept submissionsâ€”no backend code or infrastructure required. As soon as your form is deployed, you start seeing submissions appear in your Netlify dashboard.

Just add the `netlify` attribute to any form and everything gets wired up automatically. Our bots find your forms by inspecting the HTML of your site before its published.

# Features that take Netlify forms further

1. As the submissions roll in, Netlify can provide notification via email, Slack, or webhooks.

2. Netlify carefully collects every form submission in your dashboard where you can view, manage, and export the data.

3. Using Netlify Zapier integration, you can connect Netlify Forms to over 1,000 other applications. Create Zendesk tickets, add Mailchimp subscribers, or add submissions to a Google spreadsheet. The possibilities are endless.

4. Remove the clutter of junk submissions with built-in spam filtering from Akismet.

5. While JavaScript is never required for Netlify Forms, you can use JavaScript to submit forms with AJAX/XHR if you'd like. That makes Netlify Forms a great companion to sites powered by Vue, React, or other modern frameworks.

Netlify Forms is free to try and affordably priced. To get started, visit;
