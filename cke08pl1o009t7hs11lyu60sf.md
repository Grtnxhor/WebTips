## Creating a Google Site

Google Sites is a structured wiki- and Web page-creation tool offered by Google. The declared goal of Google Sites is for anyone to be able to create simple web sites that support collaboration between different editors

It was launched **28 February 2008**

And, it's free. With just a standard Google account, you can make as many Google Sites as you want for free. The new Google Sites uses your Google Drive account to store images and files you share on your site, so you can even store up to 15GB of files for your sites for free, shared with your other Google apps

However, by default, the domain will be on Google, with an address like *sites.google.com/for/example.* On the other hand, users who want to have a site on their own domain would need to subscribe and create a G Suite account for $6 to $25 per user per month.
